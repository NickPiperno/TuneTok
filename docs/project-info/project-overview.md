# Project Overview

TikTok transformed how we view, share, and edit videos online. Not only did they pioneer short-form video, but they also made content creation more accessible to the masses through CapCut. The algorithm they created made "going viral" easier for even the new creator. You were no longer beholden to followers or subscribers - good content could reach the masses solely based on its quality.

But TikTok emerged in a pre-AI world. What if we could reimagine the platform with today's AI capabilities from the ground up? Instead of users spending hours editing videos, writing captions, or finding trending sounds, AI could transform raw ideas into engaging content. Rather than manually searching for content, AI could understand exactly what entertains each user. Today, we're rebuilding TikTok from an AI-first perspective, where intelligent agents enhance every aspect of creation and consumption.

There are two primary users in a Tiktok-like app:
Content Creator: Users who make and share videos
Content Consumer: Users who discover and engage with content

We will be building a content consumer app, where users can swipe through an endless feed of short music videos. It will be called TuneTok.

Here are the user stories I want to satisfy for our MVP:
1.	As a music fan, I want to swipe through an endless feed of short music videos so that I can discover new songs and artists effortlessly.
2.	As a music fan, I want to filter my feed by genre, mood, or artist type so that I can explore music that suits my current vibe.
3.	As a music fan, I want to like or dislike tracks so that the AI can refine recommendations over time.
4.	As a music fan, I want to comment on videos so that I can engage with artists and discuss music with other fans.
5.	As a music fan, I want to save songs or videos to a personal playlist so that I can listen to my favorite discoveries later.
6.	As a music fan, I want to easily follow my favorite artists so that I never miss their new releases.

For the purposes of developing TuneTok, here are the core features you should target:
1. User Authentication & Profiles
Sign up/Login (via email, Google, Apple, or social login)
User Profiles (basic info, liked/saved songs, followed artists)

2. Personalized Feed (Swipe-Based Discovery)
Endless Feed of Short Music Videos (algorithmically curated)
Swipe to Discover New Music (Up/Down for new content)
Auto-Play with AI-Picked Clips (best section of the song)

3. Music Filtering & Search
Genre/Mood Filters (e.g., Hip-Hop, Chill, Party)
Trending vs. Personalized Feeds (toggle between AI-curated & viral hits)
Search (by artist, song name, genre, mood)
Hashtags & Tags (for discovery)

4. Engagement & Social Features
Like/Dislike Songs (to refine AI recommendations)
Comment Section (for discussions & artist engagement)
Follow Artists (to get notified about new releases)
Share Videos (on social media, via direct link, etc.)

5. Saving & Playlist Management
Save Songs/Videos (to personal playlists)
Quick Playlist Creation (e.g., "Vibes," "Workout," "Chill")

We will not be building a content creator app, but we will be building a content consumer app. We will also not be adding any AI features to the app for now, but we will be adding them in the future so we will need to keep this in mind.

## Platform Support
This application is being developed for Android devices only. We are not targeting iOS or web platforms at this time.

## Development Focus
- Android-only mobile application
- Content consumption focus (no content creation features)
