# Tech Stack Options for TuneTok MVP

This document outlines recommendations for our tech stack components, based on the project overview and user flow. It details the compatibility of each component and provides popular alternatives (if any) for each part of our stack. Since this is an MVP and we aren't planning on heavy scaling, the focus is on rapid development and integration.

## Platform Support
**Target Platform:** Android only
We are specifically targeting Android devices for this MVP. iOS and web platform support is not in scope.

---

## Frontend

### 1. React Native + TypeScript
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible. Modern toolchain with static type checking via TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Notes:** While React Native supports cross-platform development, we're focusing solely on Android for this MVP.

### 2. Expo
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible with Android development.
- **Notes:** Using Expo for Android-specific development, which simplifies the build process and native module integration.
- **Configuration:** Android-specific configuration and optimizations will be prioritized.
- **Alternative:** If you require more customization or native module support later, consider ejecting to the Expo Bare Workflow or using the React Native CLI directly.

### 3. Firebase SDK (for Frontend Integration)
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible with React Native and Expo.
- **Notes:** Provides seamless integration with various Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Storage, etc.) which is great for our rapid MVP development.

## Backend Services

### 4. Firebase Auth
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible.
- **Notes:** Simplifies user management and supports various social login options; ideal for quick setup.

### 5. Firebase Cloud Storage
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible.
- **Notes:** Suited for storing media files such as videos and images; integrates seamlessly with Firebase SDK.

### 6. Firestore (NoSQL Database)
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible.
- **Notes:** Provides real-time data syncing and offline support, important for a dynamic content consumer app.

### 7. Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible.
- **Notes:** Enables running server-side logic in response to Firebase events; simplifies backend development.

### 8. Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible.
- **Notes:** Offers a robust solution for implementing push notifications in mobile apps.

### 9. Firebase Generative AI
- **Compatibility:** This is an emerging area. Firebase itself doesn't have a widely adopted, standalone generative AI service yet.
- **Notes:** If planning to integrate AI-driven features, evaluate the current maturity of Firebase's AI offerings.

### 10. FastAPI (for Custom AI Features)
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible as a standalone backend for building custom AI endpoints.
- **Notes:** Provides a fast, asynchronous Python framework for implementing custom AI features. It works well alongside Firebase services and can be deployed easily.
- **Alternative:** Flask or Django REST Framework are other Python options but FastAPI is preferred for its performance and ease of integration with modern Python async features.

### 11. Firebase App Distribution & Hosting
- **Compatibility:** Fully compatible with the Firebase ecosystem.
- **Notes:** Leverages Firebase App Distribution for efficient pre-release testing and beta distribution, and Firebase Hosting for deploying mobile components (or web assets) with fast global content delivery. This integration streamlines updates and ensures reliable uptime.

## Summary

For our MVP, the proposed tech stack is largely compatible and well-integrated:

- **Frontend:** React Native + TypeScript with Expo and Firebase SDK are all standard, mature tools that support rapid app development.
- **Backend:** Firebase services (Auth, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging) provide a cohesive solution to manage data, media, and notifications. 
- **AI Integration:** Firebase Generative AI. FastAPI is a strong choice for custom AI endpoint development.

This setup is designed for a swift MVP build without heavy scaling demands, providing both simplicity and flexibility. Let me know if you would like to adjust any components or explore further alternatives.
