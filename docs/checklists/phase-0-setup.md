# Phase 0: Project Setup

This initial setup phase ensures that all necessary tools, dependencies, and configurations are in place to develop TuneTok. Follow this checklist to establish a stable and efficient development environment.

## Checklist:

[✓] SETUP: Ensure that Node.js (v14 or later) and your preferred package manager (npm or yarn) are installed.
[✓] SETUP: ~~Install Expo CLI globally with 'npm install -g expo-cli'~~ (Using new local Expo CLI instead)
[✓] SETUP: Create new Expo project with 'npx create-expo-app TuneTok -t expo-template-blank-typescript'
[✓] SETUP: Run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install all dependencies
[ ] SETUP: Install Expo Go app on your Android device for testing
[✓] SETUP: Create a .env file and configure necessary environment variables
[✓] SETUP: Set up your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode) with recommended extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - React Native Tools
  - Expo Tools
[✓] SETUP: Configure ESLint and Prettier for code standards
[✓] SETUP: Verify that tsconfig.json is properly configured for Expo
[✓] SETUP: Initialize Git repository and set up remote tracking
[✓] SETUP: Create initial commit with baseline configuration

## Notes:
- ESLint and Prettier have been configured with React Native and TypeScript support
- Environment variables template has been created (.env.template)
- Added npm scripts for linting and formatting:
  - `npm run lint`: Check for code issues
  - `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fix code issues
  - `npm run format`: Format all files
  - `npm run format:check`: Check if files are properly formatted
- Follow the Codebase Best Practices guidelines for documentation and file organization
- Update the setup steps as necessary when new tools or dependencies are introduced
- Ensure all configurations are reviewed and tested before proceeding with feature development

## Expo-specific Notes:
- Using Expo Go for development and testing
- Android-only focus as specified in project requirements
- Development will use Expo's managed workflow

## Next Steps:
- Install Expo Go on your Android device to begin testing
- Test the development environment by running `npm start` and connecting with Expo Go
