# Phase 5: Saving & Playlist Management

This phase enables users to save their favorite content and manage playlists, including creation, editing, and deletion of playlists. This feature enhances content personalization and user retention.

## Features:
- Save Content (songs/videos) to a personal collection
- Playlist Creation
- Playlist Management (edit, delete, reorder saved items)

## Checklist:

[ ] FRONTEND: Design and integrate a save button on content screens with clear visual indicators (e.g., icon change or animation) when saved.
[ ] FRONTEND: Build a dedicated screen for users to view, create, edit, and delete playlists.
[ ] FRONTEND: Include features for reordering saved items within a playlist.
[ ] FRONTEND: Provide immediate visual (and/or haptic) feedback when content is saved or when a playlist is modified.
[ ] FRONTEND: Ensure easy navigation to the playlist management screen from the main feed or user profile.
[ ] FRONTEND: Display clear error messages and fallback UI for save and playlist actions in case of connectivity or processing errors.
[ ] BACKEND: Extend the Firestore schema to include collections/documents for saved content and user playlists.
[ ] BACKEND: Develop or update backend endpoints/Cloud Functions to handle CRUD operations for playlists and saving/un-saving content.
[ ] BACKEND: Implement strict security rules to ensure that saved content and playlists are accessible only to the owning user.
[ ] BACKEND: Optimize queries and data writes for efficient playlist management, particularly for users with a large library.
[ ] BACKEND: Implement a backup or sync mechanism to minimize risk of data loss in case of network or service disruptions.

## Notes:
- Ensure that the frontend design follows the UI and Theme Rules for consistent styling.
- All implementations should be documented according to Codebase Best Practices, with proper JSDoc/TSDoc annotations.
- Test thoroughly across devices to ensure reliability and performance.
