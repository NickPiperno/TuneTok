  - Performance issues may arise with large lists or animations if not properly optimized.
  - Asynchronous code and state management can become complex without careful structuring.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style.
  - Modularize code by splitting components logically and reusing common UI elements.
  - Follow React Native performance guidelines and best practices from the documentation.

### 2. Expo
- **Best Practices:**
  - Utilize the managed workflow for rapid prototyping and simplified configuration.
  - Take advantage of Expo's over-the-air updates for quick bug fixes and feature rollouts.
  - Use Expo SDK libraries to handle common tasks like push notifications, location, and sensors.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Advanced native functionality might be limited in the managed workflow.
  - Ejecting from Expo can be challenging if heavy customization is needed later.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Keep your Expo CLI and SDK versions up-to-date.
  - Plan for potential ejection by isolating dependencies.
  - Follow Expo documentation closely for asset management and performance optimization.

### 3. Firebase SDK (for Frontend Integration)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Initialize Firebase in a centralized module to streamline configuration.
  - Use environment variables to securely manage Firebase configuration details.
  - Modularize Firebase service interactions (Auth, Firestore, Storage, etc.) for easier testing and maintenance.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Be cautious with real-time listeners; excessive use can impact performance.
  - Ensure secure handling of API keys and configurations.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Adhere to Firebase security rules for data protection.
  - Use caching techniques provided by Firebase for offline support.
  - Regularly update the Firebase SDK to avoid deprecated features or breaking changes.

## Backend Services

### 4. Firebase Auth
- **Best Practices:**
  - Implement multiple sign-in methods (email/password, social providers) to increase accessibility.
  - Link user accounts to avoid duplicates when users sign in through different avenues.
  - Follow Firebase security best practices to safeguard user data.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Rate limits may impact high-frequency authentication scenarios.
  - Handle edge cases for sign-in failures or network interruptions gracefully.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Use FirebaseUI for rapid authentication prototyping.
  - Document authentication flows and error handling strategies.
  - Test authentication across different devices and network conditions.

---

### 5. Firebase Cloud Storage
- **Best Practices:**
  - Secure file uploads with robust Firebase Storage security rules.
  - Validate file sizes and formats on the client side before uploading.
  - Utilize metadata for better organization and retrieval of media files.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Storage costs can increase as the volume of media files grows.
  - Network latency may affect upload and download performance.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Use resumable uploads for large files.
  - Structure storage paths logically to aid scalability and security.
  - Monitor usage and cost metrics via Firebase Console.

---

### 6. Firestore (NoSQL Database)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Design data models to minimize read and write costs.
  - Use batched writes and transactions for consistency.
  - Index commonly queried fields to enhance performance.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Complex queries may require multiple indexes and impact performance.
  - Firestore pricing can escalate with high-volume operations.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Implement robust security rules to control data access.
  - Enable offline persistence to mitigate network issues.
  - Regularly review and optimize your data model based on usage patterns.

---

### 7. Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Best Practices:**
  - Develop idempotent functions to handle retries gracefully.
  - Use background triggers for non-blocking, asynchronous processing.
  - Log extensively and monitor performance in the Firebase Console.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Cold starts can introduce latency in user-facing scenarios.
  - Execution time limits require functions to be kept lightweight.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Organize functions by context or domain (e.g., user actions, media processing).
  - Design functions with clear error handling and retry mechanisms.
  - Test functions in various scenarios, especially under load.

---

### 8. Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Best Practices:**
  - Segment users for targeted messaging strategies.
  - Utilize topics for broad notifications and personalized channels.
  - Schedule notifications to align with user engagement patterns.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Token management is critical for reliable message delivery.
  - Behavior and notification appearance can vary across different operating systems.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Regularly clean up outdated tokens.
  - Respect user preferences and device settings regarding notifications.
  - Perform cross-platform testing to ensure consistency.

---

### 9. Firebase Generative AI
- **Best Practices:**
  - Experiment in development stages and monitor performance metrics closely.
  - Secure AI endpoints and data exchanges rigorously.
  - Log model outputs to analyze performance and accuracy.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - As an emerging service, documentation and stability may be limited.
  - Latency and quality of outputs may not meet production standards initially.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Have fallback mechanisms in case of service degradation.
  - Stay updated with Firebase releases and community findings regarding AI integrations.
  - Evaluate alternative AI solutions if the service does not mature sufficiently.

---

### 10. FastAPI (for Custom AI Features)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Utilize asynchronous endpoints to handle concurrent requests effectively.
  - Maintain clear API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger) standards.
  - Implement dependency injection for clean, scalable code.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - Requires familiarity with asynchronous programming in Python.
  - Performance tuning may be required for high-traffic scenarios.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Follow PEP 8 for coding standards.
  - Configure CORS, security policies, and proper error handling.
  - Use automated tests (e.g., pytest) to ensure API reliability.

---

### 11. Firebase App Distribution & Hosting
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use App Distribution for efficient beta testing and iterative feedback.
  - Deploy static assets and mobile web components using Firebase Hosting.
  - Leverage CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment with Firebase CLI.
- **Limitations & Pitfalls:**
  - App Distribution is designed for pre-release testing rather than full-scale production deployments.
  - Firebase Hosting is optimized for static content; dynamic backends should be hosted separately.
- **Conventions & Considerations:**
  - Keep deployment scripts simple and version-controlled.
  - Monitor hosting performance and implement caching strategies.
  - Use Firebase CLI for consistent, reproducible deployments.
