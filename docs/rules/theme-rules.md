# Theme Rules for TuneTok MVP

This document defines our visual design guidelines and theming principles for the TuneTok MVP.

## 1. General Design Approach

- **Minimalist & Sleek:**
  - Clean, uncluttered interfaces that focus on the primary contentâ€”music videos and imagery.
- **Subtle Color Palette:**
  - Use muted tones with support for both light and dark modes. Avoid neon or harsh gradients.
- **Typography-First:**
  - Emphasize elegant, legible sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, Montserrat) to maintain a premium look.
- **Flat Design:**
  - Avoid excessive effects; use intuitive layouts with natural shadows and layering for depth.

## 2. Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Muted & Modern)

- **Dark Mode Background:**
  - Soft Black (#121212) to provide a deep, immersive experience.
- **Light Mode Background:**
  - Off-White (#F5F5F5) for a clean, bright interface.
- **Primary Accent:**
  - Muted Blue or Slate Gray can be used for subtle highlights and borders.
- **Secondary Accents:**
  - Deep Burgundy or Olive Green for interactive elements such as buttons, icons, and active states.

### Accent Colors (Minimal Use)

- **Highlight Colors:**
  - Muted Copper (#B67B5D) or Warm Sand (#D6B99D) for small, eye-catching elements.
- **Secondary Elements:**
  - Dark Blue-Gray (#37474F) for non-intrusive accents helping to demarcate UI sections.

## 3. Typography & Text Styling

- **Primary Font:**
  - Use modern, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, Montserrat).
- **Hierarchy:**
  - Headings should be bold and larger for prominence.
  - Body text should have subtle weight differences to maintain hierarchy (e.g., song titles larger than artist names).
- **Legibility:**
  - Ensure adequate contrast between text and background across both light and dark modes.

## 4. Layout and Component Styles

### Navigation

- **Bottom Navigation Bar:**
  - Simple, recognizable icons (Home, Search, Library, Profile). Ensure icons are intuitive and easy to tap.
- **Swipe-Based Interaction:**
  - Implement swipe gestures for browsing content in a TikTok-like style.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB):**
  - Use for key actions, such as accessing playlists, ensuring it stands out without overwhelming other elements.

### Video Feed & Content Display

- **Full-Screen Video Player:**
  - Employ a minimal overlay design. Use auto-hide controls to ensure an immersive viewing experience.
- **Engagement Icons:**
  - Place interactive icons (like, comment, share) in consistent locations (e.g., bottom-right corner) that are accessible yet unobtrusive.

### Search & Filtering

- **Search Bar:**
  - Rounded, clean design with intuitive placement. Avoid excessive dropdowns or clutter.
- **Filter Buttons:**
  - Use pill-shaped designs for selecting genres or moods, emphasizing ease of selection through clear visual feedback.

### Profile & Playlists

- **Profile Cards:**
  - Minimalist, card-based layouts with soft shadows to add depth without distraction.
- **Toggle Views:**
  - Allow switching between grid and list views for saved songs and artist profiles.

## 5. Dark & Light Mode Guidelines

- **Contrast and Readability:**
  - In dark mode, use soft contrasts to maintain readability (e.g., light text on dark backgrounds).
  - In light mode, ensure text is clear against off-white backgrounds.
- **Consistent Theming:**
  - Both modes should harmonize with the overall muted color palette, ensuring no harsh contrasts.
- **Dynamic Switching:**
  - Allow smooth transitions between dark and light modes without jarring effects.

## 6. Integration with the Tech Stack

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure that UI components dynamically adjust based on screen size and orientation using React Native's styling capabilities.
- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Use style pre-processing and caching where possible (e.g., StyleSheet in React Native) to maintain fluid interactions.
- **Real-Time Data:**
  - Design components to gracefully handle real-time updates from backend services such as Firestore.
- **Error States:**
  - Provide clear, minimalist visual cues for error handling (e.g., subtle color changes, icons) aligned with the theme.

## 7. Key UI Design Principles

- **Clarity over Complexity:** Avoid overwhelming the user with too much information on any screen.
- **Depth with Shadows, Not Neon:** Use subtle drop shadows and layering to create a sense of depth without resorting to bright or flashy effects.
- **Content is King:** Let the media (music videos, album covers) be the focal point of the interface.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent spacing, iconography, and typography throughout the app.
- **Adaptability:** Ensure that the design is flexible enough to evolve as additional features are integrated.
