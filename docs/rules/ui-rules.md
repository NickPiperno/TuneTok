# UI Rules for TuneTok MVP

This document outlines the visual and interaction guidelines for building the user interface components of TuneTok. These rules ensure that our UI is intuitive, consistent, and performs well in tandem with our tech stack and backend services.

## General Design Principles

- **Minimalist & Sleek:** Focus on a clean UI that lets content (videos and music) take center stage.
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Every screen should have a clear purpose with minimal clutter.
- **Content-Centric:** The design should highlight music videos, album covers, and artist profiles without intrusive UI elements.
- **Consistency:** Follow uniform interaction patterns and maintain coherence across components.

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Typography

- Use modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, Montserrat) for a premium, legible look.
- **Hierarchy:** Headings should be bold and larger; body text should use subtle weight differences. For example, song titles should be more prominent than artist names.
- **Consistency:** Ensure font sizes and spacing remain consistent across all views.

### 2. Navigation

- **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Use simple, recognizable icons for Home, Search, Library, and Profile. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping.
- **Swipe Navigation:** Implement swipe-based interactions for a TikTok-like browsing experience.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB):** Provide a FAB for quick access to playlist features.

### 3. Video Feed (Music Discovery)

- **Full-Screen Display:** The video player should use the full screen with minimal UI overlays.
- **Auto-Hiding Controls:** Controls (e.g., play/pause, like, comment, share) should fade out to optimize immersion.
- **Engagement Icons:** Place small, interactive icons in accessible locations (e.g., bottom-right corner) for quick actions such as liking or sharing.
- **Performance Integration:** Tie the video feed with backend services (e.g., Firestore for real-time updates, Cloud Functions for engagement logic) to ensure smooth interactions.

### 4. Search & Filtering

- **Search Bar:** Use a clean, rounded-edge search bar that's simple and intuitive.
- **Filter Buttons:** Design pill-shaped buttons for genre and mood selection. They should be easy to tap without overwhelming the UI.
- **Visual Simplicity:** Avoid complicated dropdowns; prioritize visual clarity.

### 5. Profile & Playlists

- **Profile Cards:** Use minimalist card designs for artist profiles with soft shadows to convey depth without distraction.
- **Toggle Views:** Provide options to switch between grid and list views for saved songs or playlists.
- **Interaction Consistency:** Ensure that user actions like following an artist or saving a track are accompanied by clear, subtle animations.

## Interaction Guidelines

- **Responsiveness:** All touch interactions (swipe, tap, long-press) should feel responsive with minimal delay.
- **Feedback:** Include subtle animations or haptic feedback where appropriate to confirm user actions.
- **Performance:** Adhere to React Native and Expo performance principles (e.g., lazy loading, memoization) to improve responsiveness on all devices.
- **Error Handling:** UI elements that depend on backend data (e.g., real-time updates from Firestore) should have graceful fallback states in case of connectivity issues.

## Tie-Ins with the Tech Stack

- **Real-Time Data:** Leverage Firestore for dynamic updates on the video feed and comment sections.
- **Push Notifications:** Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging, ensuring any UI notifications are unobtrusive but noticeable.
- **Cloud Functions:** Use Firebase Cloud Functions for processing user interactions (e.g., likes, shares) without blocking the UI.
- **Consistent Theming:** Follow the theme rules for color palettes and typography to maintain a cohesive and polished look.
